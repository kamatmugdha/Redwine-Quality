# Redwine Quality Analysis
 Ever thought what makes your wine taste so good? Did you know how industry players are using product quality certifications to promote their products? This is indeed a time consuming and expensive  process as it requires assessment given by human experts. But if the human quality of tasting can be related to wine’s chemical properties  such as acidity, pH level, sugar etc., then the certification and quality assessment and assurance processes can be more controlled.
Through this project I will be focusing to answer these main questions: 
<li/>	What are the main attributes of a best quality red wine?
<li/>Is there a way to predict whether a wine is good or not in terms of quality based on available physicochemical attributes?<br/>

## Dataset:
The dataset is obtained from UCI machine learning repository and contains a total of 12 variables, which were recorded for 1,599 observations.  

## Conclusion
I used robust clustering methods, classic classification methods and was able to predict whether a certain bottle of red wine is “good” or “bad” with 91% accuracy via Random Forest model. By analyzing the physicochemical tests samples data of red wines, I created a model that can help industry producers, distributors, and sellers predict the quality of red wine products and have a better understanding of major features. Also, Random Forest-based feature sets performed the best. Also, the four of the features as the most influential: alcohol, sulphates, volatile acidity, and citric acid.
